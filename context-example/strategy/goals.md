- [ ] **10+ hours saved per week** - Teams report time savings (survey)

**Owner:** Product team

**Status:** At Risk (need to improve onboarding)

## What We're NOT Doing

*Explicitly deprioritized items (important for focus).*

- **Mobile apps** - Not yet (focus on web experience first)
- **Enterprise features** - Not targeting 50+ person teams yet
- **AI features** - Not a priority (creative teams skeptical of AI)
- **White-label** - Not yet (may consider later)

---

## Key Metrics

*The metrics that matter most right now.*

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Paying Teams** | 12 | 100 | On Track |
| **MRR** | $708 | $5,900 | On Track |
| **Trial-to-Paid Conversion** | 45% | 70% | At Risk |
| **Weekly Active Users** | 65% | 80% | At Risk |
| **NPS** | 3.2 | 4.0+ | At Risk |
| **Churn Rate** | 8% | <5% | At Risk |

---

## Risks & Challenges

| Risk/Challenge | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|----------------|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Low team adoption** | High | Medium | Improve onboarding, gather feedback, iterate |
| **High churn** | High | Medium | Understand why teams leave, address pain points |
| **Competitor response** | Medium | Low | Focus on creative-specific features they can't easily copy |
| **Market education** | Medium | Medium | Content marketing, case studies, peer recommendations |

---

## Open Questions

*Items requiring follow-up or clarification.*

- [ ] Should we add a free tier to improve trial-to-paid conversion?
- [ ] How important is Figma integration? (High priority feature request)
- [ ] Should we target in-house teams more aggressively? (Less price-sensitive)
