## Product Summary

**FlowSpace** is a visual-first project management platform that combines project planning, file collaboration, and client communication in one place—built specifically for remote creative teams.

**Tagline:** Where creative teams actually get work done.

**North Star Metric:** Teams save 10+ hours per week on project management overhead.

---

## Core Offerings

### FlowSpace Platform

**Problem solved:** Creative teams waste 2-3 hours per day context-switching between project management, file sharing, and communication tools. They lack visibility into project status and struggle to keep clients informed.

**Target user:** Remote creative teams (agencies, studios, in-house teams) of 5-50 people. See [Creative Director persona](../customers/customer-personas.md#primary-persona-creative-director--agency-owner).

**What it is:**
FlowSpace combines project management, file collaboration, and client communication in a visual-first interface designed for creative workflows. Unlike generic PM tools, FlowSpace adapts to how creative teams actually work—with boards for visual projects, timelines for campaigns, and kanban for production workflows.

**Key Features:**

| Feature | Benefit | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Visual Project Views** | Boards, timelines, kanban—choose what fits each project | Creative work is visual; project management should be too |
| **Native File Collaboration** | Upload, preview, comment on files without leaving FlowSpace | No more hunting for files across Dropbox, Drive, email |
| **Client Portal** | Clients see project progress, give feedback, approve work—all in one place | Eliminates email back-and-forth and scattered communication |
| **Flexible Workflows** | Adapt to different project types—campaigns, rebrands, ongoing work | One tool that fits all creative work, not just one workflow |
| **Team Collaboration** | @mentions, comments, status updates—all in context of the work | Team stays aligned without constant Slack pings |
| **Project Templates** | Start new projects quickly with proven workflows | Consistency without reinventing the wheel |

**Pricing:**

| Plan | Monthly | Annual | Includes |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| **Starter** | $29/team/mo | $290/team/yr | Up to 10 team members, unlimited projects, 50GB storage |
| **Professional** | $59/team/mo | $590/team/yr | Up to 25 team members, unlimited projects, 200GB storage, client portal, advanced reporting |
| **Studio** | $99/team/mo | $990/team/yr | Up to 50 team members, unlimited projects, 500GB storage, custom branding, priority support |

**Notes:**
- Annual pricing saves ~17% (2 months free)
- "Team" = all team members, not per-seat
- Client collaborators are free (unlimited)
- 14-day free trial, no credit card required

## Differentiators

*What makes FlowSpace different from alternatives.*

**Core differentiation:** Built specifically for creative teams, not adapted from software development or generic business processes.

**Key differentiators:**
1. **Visual-first interface** — Projects displayed as boards and timelines, not just lists
2. **All-in-one without bloat** — Project management + files + client communication, not a suite of disconnected tools
3. **Flexible workflows** — Adapts to different project types, not one rigid process
4. **Remote-first by design** — Every feature optimized for distributed teams

**Positioning statement:** The project management platform built for how creative teams actually work.

---

## Competitive Positioning

| Alternative | What They Provide | What FlowSpace Adds |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Asana/Trello** | Generic project management | Visual-first interface + file collaboration + client portal built for creatives |
| **Monday.com** | Customizable project management | Simpler, more focused on creative workflows, better file handling |
| **Notion** | All-in-one workspace | More structured for project management, better client communication |
| **Dropbox + Asana + Slack** | Separate tools for each need | One tool that does it all, eliminates context-switching |
| **Basecamp** | Simple project management | More visual, better file collaboration, built for creative work |

**Key insight:** Most alternatives are either too generic (don't fit creative workflows) or too complex (overwhelming for small teams). FlowSpace hits the sweet spot: powerful enough for real projects, simple enough that teams actually use it.

---

## Pricing Strategy

**Model:** Per-team subscription (not per-seat)

**Rationale:** 
- Creative teams vary in size throughout projects
- Per-seat pricing penalizes teams for growth
- Per-team pricing aligns with value (one team = one subscription)

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- **Asana:** $13.49/user/mo → $67/mo for 5-person team vs. FlowSpace $29/team
- **Monday.com:** $10/user/mo → $50/mo for 5-person team vs. FlowSpace $29/team
- **Basecamp:** $99/mo flat → More expensive for small teams, cheaper for large teams

**Value proposition:** FlowSpace is more affordable for small teams (5-15 people) and competitive for larger teams, with the added benefit of unlimited client collaborators.
