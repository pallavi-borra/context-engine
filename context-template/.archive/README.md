# Archive

Place deprecated context documents here instead of deleting them.

This preserves history and allows rollback if needed.

## When to Archive

- Document has been replaced by a newer version
- Information is no longer relevant but may be useful for reference
- Content has been merged into another document

## Naming Convention

When archiving, add a date suffix:
- `company-brief-ARCHIVED-04JAN2026.md`
