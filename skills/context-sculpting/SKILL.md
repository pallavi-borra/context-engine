# Context Sculpting Skill

## Overview

The Context Sculpting skill maintains the business context system—a composable set of documents that provide LLMs with the information needed to perform tasks well. This skill ensures coherent, high-quality institutional knowledge across all context files.

### Why This Skill Exists

LLMs produce expert-quality work when given sufficient context. Without context, they produce generic output. This skill solves the maintenance problem: **how do we keep context accurate, coherent, and well-organized as the business evolves?**

### Core Principles

1. **One source of truth** - Each fact lives in exactly one place; cross-reference, don't duplicate
2. **Progressive disclosure** - Overview documents link to detail documents for depth
3. **Coherence across files** - Changes in one document may require updates in related documents
4. **Open questions captured** - Unknown items are explicitly tracked, not glossed over
5. **Architecture awareness** - Every change must consider the broader context structure
6. **Agent continuity** - Any agent without prior history can understand and maintain the system

### Capabilities

- Update context documents with new information from interviews or research
- Maintain cross-links and relationships between documents
- Track open questions requiring follow-up
- Audit context health and identify gaps or inconsistencies
- Integrate new insights across multiple related documents
- Keep the architecture mapping current with any structural changes

## Critical Knowledge Files

**ALWAYS load these files before ANY context operation:**

| File | Purpose | Load When |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `knowledge/context-architecture.md` | **REQUIRED** - Complete map of all context files, their purposes, and relationships | EVERY operation |
| `knowledge/document-standards.md` | Metadata, naming, and structural conventions | Creating or modifying documents |
| `knowledge/cross-linking-guide.md` | How to create and maintain links between documents | Any multi-document operation |
| `knowledge/integration-patterns.md` | How to decide where information belongs and how to integrate across files | Adding new information |

---

## Workflows

This skill has three workflows. Load the appropriate workflow based on intent.

### workflow/update-context.md

**Purpose:** Add new information to the context system from any source (interview, research, observation).

**Load when:**
- New information needs to be captured in context
- User provides updates to business information
- Research or discovery produces insights to integrate
- Corrections or refinements to existing context

**Triggers (examples):**
- "Update the company brief with..."
- "Add this to our context"
- "Our target customer has changed"
- "Record this decision"

**Required dependencies - load BEFORE executing:**
- `knowledge/context-architecture.md` - To identify affected documents
- `knowledge/document-standards.md` - For formatting
- `knowledge/integration-patterns.md` - For multi-document updates
- `knowledge/cross-linking-guide.md` - For relationship maintenance

---

### workflow/interview-elicit.md

**Purpose:** Conduct structured interviews to extract business context from stakeholders.

**Load when:**
- Gathering initial context for a new domain
- Filling gaps identified in existing context
- Validating or updating stale information
- User initiates context-building conversation

**Triggers (examples):**
- "Let's fill out the company brief"
- "Interview me about our customers"
- "Help me document our values"
- "I want to capture context about..."

**Required dependencies - load BEFORE executing:**
- `knowledge/context-architecture.md` - To identify target documents
- `knowledge/document-standards.md` - For output formatting
- Target document(s) to populate - To see existing content and open questions

---

### workflow/audit-context.md

**Purpose:** Review context health—identify gaps, stale information, broken links, or inconsistencies.

**Load when:**
- Periodic maintenance review
- Before major business decisions
- After significant business changes
- User requests context health check

**Triggers (examples):**
- "Audit the context system"
- "What's missing from our context?"
- "Review context health"
- "Check for stale information"

**Required dependencies - load BEFORE executing:**
- `knowledge/context-architecture.md` - As the source of truth for expected structure

---

## Knowledge

### knowledge/context-architecture.md

**Purpose:** The master map of the entire context system. Documents all folders, files, their purposes, relationships, and the overall architecture.

**CRITICAL:** This file MUST be updated whenever:
- A new context document is created
- A context document is renamed, moved, or deleted
- The folder structure changes
- Relationships between documents change

**Contains:**
- Complete folder structure with descriptions
- Every document with its purpose and key contents
- Relationship map showing how documents connect
- Domain summaries (identity, offerings, customers, market, operations, strategy)

---

### knowledge/document-standards.md

**Purpose:** Defines all conventions for context documents—metadata, naming, structure, versioning.

**Load when:** ANY operation that creates or modifies documents

**Contains:**
- File naming conventions (simple names for context docs, dated names for artifacts)
- YAML front matter specification
- Metadata table format
- Document structure template
- Version increment rules
- Change history requirements
- Open Questions section format

---

### knowledge/cross-linking-guide.md

**Purpose:** How to create and maintain links between context documents for progressive disclosure.

**Load when:** Any operation that touches multiple documents or creates new documents

**Contains:**
- Link syntax and formatting
- "See Also" section structure
- When to link vs. when to duplicate
- Bidirectional linking patterns
- Link maintenance on document changes

---

### knowledge/integration-patterns.md

**Purpose:** Decision framework for where information belongs and how to integrate across files.

**Load when:** Adding new information that might affect multiple documents

**Contains:**
- Information placement decision tree
- Primary vs. secondary location rules
- When to update vs. when to link
- Coherence checking process
- Open questions propagation

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose | When Used |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `Read` | Load context documents | All workflows |
| `Write` | Create new context documents | New document creation |
| `Edit` | Modify existing documents | Updates, corrections |
| `Glob` | Discover all context files | Audit workflow, architecture sync |
| `Grep` | Search across context | Finding related content, checking consistency |

---

## The Context Architecture

The context system uses six core domains:

```
context/  (or context-template/, context-example/, or your custom path)
├── identity/       # Who we are (mission, values, voice)
├── offerings/      # What we sell (products, pricing, value props)
├── customers/      # Who we serve (personas, journey, signals)
├── market/         # Where we compete (landscape, competitors)
├── operations/     # How we work (team, processes, tools)
└── strategy/       # Where we're going (goals, initiatives, risks)
```

**Note:** The folder name may vary (`context/`, `context-template/`, `context-example/`, or a custom path). The structure remains the same.

**See `knowledge/context-architecture.md` for the complete current state.**

---

## Execution Rules

**These rules are mandatory. Deviations will cause coherence failures.**

### Before ANY Context Operation

1. **Load `knowledge/context-architecture.md` FIRST** - You must understand the current state
2. **Identify ALL affected documents** - Changes often ripple across multiple files
3. **Load required workflow** - Don't improvise; follow the documented process
4. **Load all workflow dependencies** - As listed in the workflow section above

### During Execution

1. **Follow the workflow steps in order** - No skipping, no optimization
2. **Update ALL affected documents** - Don't leave related documents inconsistent
3. **Maintain cross-links** - Add links to new content; update links if content moves
4. **Capture open questions** - Unknown items go in the Open Questions section
5. **Update the architecture map** - If structure changes, update `context-architecture.md`
6. **Use the document standards** - Correct metadata, versioning, formatting

### Information Placement Rules

1. **Facts live in ONE place** - Choose the primary document; link from secondary locations
2. **Overview before detail** - Brief mentions in overview docs; full detail in specialized docs
3. **Domain determines home** - Information goes in its natural domain first
4. **Cross-link for discovery** - Related content should be findable via links

### Quality Standards

1. **No orphan documents** - Every document must be linked from at least one other document
2. **No broken links** - All links must point to existing documents
3. **No stale Open Questions** - Regularly review and resolve or update open questions
4. **Consistent voice** - Match the established voice/tone across documents

### If Uncertain

- Re-read the relevant workflow and knowledge files
- Check `context-architecture.md` for guidance on where things belong
- Ask the user for clarification using numbered response options
- Do NOT improvise document structure or placement

## Integration with Primary Agent

This skill should be invoked proactively during conversations:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| User shares business information | Consider if it should update context |
| Strategic decisions are made | Record in relevant context documents |
| New insights from research | Integrate into context via update workflow |
| User asks about the business | Load relevant context; note if gaps exist |
| Periodic check-ins | Suggest context audit if not done recently |

**The goal is continuous improvement of institutional knowledge quality.**

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Duplicate information across files | Single source of truth + cross-links |
| Update one doc, leave related docs stale | Update all affected documents |
| Add new doc without architecture update | Always update `context-architecture.md` |
| Gloss over unknowns | Capture in Open Questions section |
| Improvise document structure | Follow document standards exactly |
| Skip loading knowledge files | Always load required dependencies first |

---

## Failure Modes

If these occur, stop and correct:

1. **Architecture drift** - Actual files don't match `context-architecture.md` → Run audit workflow
2. **Broken links** - Links point to non-existent documents → Fix links or restore documents
3. **Inconsistent information** - Same fact differs across documents → Identify source of truth, correct others
4. **Orphan documents** - Files exist but aren't linked from anywhere → Add links or archive
5. **Stale open questions** - Questions unchanged for extended periods → Review and resolve

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE RULES WILL DEGRADE CONTEXT QUALITY.**
