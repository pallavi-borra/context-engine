## Overview

The context system provides LLMs with business information needed for task execution. It follows a domain-based architecture with six core domains, each containing documents at varying levels of detail.

**Location:** `context/` (or `context-template/`, `context-example/`, or your custom path)

**Design principles:**
- One source of truth per fact
- Progressive disclosure via cross-links
- Open questions explicitly tracked
- Architecture map always current
